  - "error: <unknown>:0:0: in function tracepoint__raw_syscalls__sys_enter i32 (%struct.tracepoint__raw_syscalls__sys_enter*): Looks like the BPF stack limit of 512 bytes is exceeded. Please move large on stack variables into BPF per-cpu array map."
  - need to use per-cpu array map instead? look into this
