# Changing Number of Syscalls to Trace

- tracing sequences of length 100
  - "error: <unknown>:0:0: in function tracepoint__raw_syscalls__sys_enter i32 (%struct.tracepoint__raw_syscalls__sys_enter*): Looks like the BPF stack limit of 512 bytes is exceeded. Please move large on stack variables into BPF per-cpu array map."
  - need to use per-cpu array map instead? look into this

- tracing sequences of length 400
  - "error: <unknown>:0:0: in function tracepoint__raw_syscalls__sys_enter i32 (%struct.tracepoint__raw_syscalls__sys_enter*): A call to built-in function 'memset' is not supported."

# Preliminary Tests of the Software

- what did I notice a lot of?
  - 202 (futex), used for blocking?
  - running ls
    - a lot of 45
    - some 7
    - some 3
    - some 1
    - some 202
