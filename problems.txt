problems:

- (H) no current hash_of_maps support
    - I opened an issue for this https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2347
    - maybe there is another way to implement lookahead pairs?
- (H) delaying systemcalls? everything is BPF is readonly, no support for sleeping or blocking (maybe spinlock could help with this?)
    - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2336
- (M) race conditions in kernel versions < 5.1
